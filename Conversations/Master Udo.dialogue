~ ChangeinPerspective

Master Udo: Ah, Tamaki, my clever Ninja Catgirl! Master Udo sees that Tamaki is puzzled, nya. What seems to be the issue, my apprentice?
Tamaki: Tamaki doesn't understand, Master! One moment Tamaki was leaping through platforms, and now everything is so... up and down! Why did the world flip like a cat in midair?
Master Udo: Nyahaha, patience, Tamaki. It seems our surroundings have shifted. We are now in an adventurous realm, an atop-down RPG, where the paths are not just left and right but all around, nya. Your ninja skills will be purrfectly suited for this new challenge!
Tamaki: A-atop-down RPG, Master? Tamaki doesn't get it! Is this some kind of feline magic?
Master Udo: Not magic, my swift little ninja. It's a different game genre, where the perspective has changed. Instead of leaping between platforms, you navigate a vast world with different dimensions. Think of it as exploring a sandbox full of quests and surprises.
Master Udo: Nyahaha! That's the spirit, Tamaki. Onward, my feline apprentice, to new heights and depths of ninja mastery!
